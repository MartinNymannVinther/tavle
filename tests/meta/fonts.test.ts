/**
 * The type is in the repository and the build reaches for nothing.
 *
 * `next/font/google` self-hosts what it downloads, so there was never a
 * runtime call to Google - but `pnpm build`, and so every `docker build`,
 * fetched fonts.googleapis.com. That makes the build non-hermetic and puts
 * a US host in the path of it, which dogma two does not allow: cut the
 * internet and everything essential still works, building included.
 *
 * So the faces are files now, and these are the three ways that can rot:
 * an import of next/font creeping back in, a rule pointing at a file that
 * is not there, and a file sitting there that no rule opens. The last one
 * is the debt this replaced - `public/fonts` carried Ajour's two Archivo
 * `.ttf` files for a whole release, read by a PDF renderer Tavle does not
 * have. They are gone, and the sweep below is over every font file in the
 * directory rather than only the ones in use, so the next leftover is
 * caught by the suite instead of by a reader a release later.

 * Comments out. Both halves of this change had to explain themselves in

 * cannot tell the explanation from the thing explained would ban writing

 * whole-line `//` is stripped, so a `https://` inside a rule survives.
