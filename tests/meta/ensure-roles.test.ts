 * The roles the application logs in as have to be able to log in.

 * first real deployment the roles existed, owned nothing, and were NOLOGIN,
 * so the app was refused by its own database and the only symptom was a
 * health check answering 503 with an empty log.
 *
 * Run against a throwaway role rather than tavle_app, because changing the
 * password of the role every other suite connects with would be a cure
 * worse than the disease.
