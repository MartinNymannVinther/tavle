 * Every database URL the suite sees points at a `_test` sibling, never at
 * the one in `.env`. Resolved here so it applies to the workers, to the
 * global setup, and to the application's own connection pools when a test
 * calls a service function. Throws if the result is not clearly a test
 * database — the suite drops the whole schema, and once was enough.
 *
 * Vite's native config loader prints an advisory about importing a .ts
 * file here. Harmless: the alternatives are duplicating the guard or
 * dropping its types, and neither is worth a quieter startup.
