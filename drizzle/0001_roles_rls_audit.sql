-- The foundation's security model in one migration: runtime roles,
-- least-privilege grants, row-level security on every table, the append-only
-- audit log with its triggers, and the admission tables' confinement. This is
-- the Haij foundation (docs/adr/0001) applied to Tavle (via Ajour); the reasoning lives in
-- docs/adr/0002 (tenancy), 0003 (audit) and 0004 (admission).
--
-- Roles are created NOLOGIN if missing so this migration is self-contained;
-- provisioning (scripts/ensure-roles.ts, docker/postgres-init/01-roles.sh)
-- sets LOGIN and passwords. Migrations must run as a superuser (docs/deploy.md).
