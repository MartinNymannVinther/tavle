#!/bin/bash
# Creates the two runtime database roles at cluster initialization.
#
# - tavle_app:  the application role for all domain queries, fully subject to RLS
# - tavle_auth: the role Better Auth uses; only granted access to auth tables
#
# Passwords come from the environment (see docker-compose files). Migrations
# create the roles as NOLOGIN if they are missing, so this script only needs to
# guarantee LOGIN + password. It is idempotent.
#
# Two things are deliberate here. The passwords are required rather than
# defaulted: a fallback of "the role name as its own password" is worse
# than a failure, because it works. And they are passed to psql as
# variables and quoted with format(%L) inside the database rather than
# pasted into SQL by the shell, so a password containing a quote breaks
# nothing and injects nothing. scripts/ensure-roles.ts does the same and
# says why.
#
# The statements are built with a plain SELECT and run with \gexec rather
# than inside a DO block: psql interpolates :'var' only outside quoted
# literals, and a DO body is one big dollar-quoted literal. An earlier
# version put the variables inside the block, which Postgres read as a
# syntax error, and the container died on the first start with nothing
# but "exited (3)" to show for it. tests/meta/postgres-init.test.ts runs
# this script for real so that cannot come back.
