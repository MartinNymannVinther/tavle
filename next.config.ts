/**
 * The content policy.
 *
 * Tavle is in a good position to have a strict one: nothing in the app
 * renders HTML it did not write (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` appears
 * nowhere), and no script, style, image or font is loaded from another
 * host - the two typefaces are files in `public/fonts`. So everything is
 * 'self', and the two exceptions are named rather than assumed:
 *
 * - script-src keeps 'unsafe-inline' because Next.js writes its own
 *   bootstrap script inline and next-themes writes the one that sets the
 *   theme before the first paint. Removing it means a per-request nonce,
 *   which in turn means every page renders dynamically — a real trade
 *   with a real cost, and one that deserves its own change rather than a
 *   line in a hardening pass. What is here already stops a script being
 *   loaded from anywhere else, which is the vector that matters.
 * - style-src keeps it because next-themes and Base UI both inject style
 *   elements. An inline style is a far smaller thing than an inline script.
 *
 * img-src allows data: for the TOTP enrolment QR code, which is drawn to
 * a data URL, and blob: for PDFs opened in a tab.
 *
 * Three directives are relaxed outside production, and all three are
 * about `next dev` on http://localhost rather than about the policy:
 *
 * - 'unsafe-eval', because React's development build rebuilds stack
 *   traces with eval(). The production bundle does not.
 * - ws: on connect-src, for the hot-reload socket. 'self' is an origin,
 *   and ws://localhost is a different scheme from http://localhost, so
 *   it does not match — Chrome allows it anyway, Safari does not.
 * - upgrade-insecure-requests is left out entirely. The spec exempts
 *   loopback; WebKit does not implement that exemption, so in Safari on
 *   http://localhost every stylesheet and script is rewritten to https,
 *   nothing answers, and the page renders as bare HTML. Chrome does
 *   exempt it, which is exactly why testing in one browser was not
 *   enough. In production everything is https already and HSTS is doing
 *   this job properly.
