# Production image for Tavle. Multi-stage:
#   deps     -> install node_modules once
#   build    -> next build (standalone output)
#   migrator -> minimal image that runs drizzle migrations (compose "migrate")
#   runner   -> non-root runtime serving the standalone build

# The migrator carries the full install, dev dependencies included.
#
# A --prod install would be the better shape here, because this image
# holds the Postgres superuser connection string and has no need of
# eslint or vitest next to it. It was tried and reverted at the launch:
# `pnpm db:migrate` runs the scripts through tsx, tsx is a development
# dependency, and `pnpm add --prod tsx` on top of a --prod install does
# not place the binary, so the step fails with `sh: tsx: not found` after
# the database is already up. See TECH-DEBT.md for what a real fix needs.
