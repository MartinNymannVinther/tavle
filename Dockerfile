#   build     -> next build (standalone output)
#   migrator  -> minimal image that runs drizzle migrations (compose "migrate")
#   runner    -> non-root runtime serving the standalone build

# Node 25 and later no longer ship corepack, so pnpm is installed outright.

# The migrator carries the production tree only. This image holds the

# the shadcn CLI have no business standing next to it.
#
# A --prod install was tried at the launch and reverted the same hour:
# `pnpm db:migrate` runs the scripts through tsx, tsx was a development
# dependency, and the step died with `sh: tsx: not found` after the
# database was already up. The fix was to stop lying about tsx. It runs
# in production, on every deploy, and so does dotenv (both migration
# scripts open with `import "dotenv/config"`); both are dependencies now.
# The CI step that runs this image against a port nobody listens on is
# what keeps that honest.
