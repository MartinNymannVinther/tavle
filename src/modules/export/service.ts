/**
 * The whole workspace, on its way out.
 *
 * Full export is a dogma: you must be able to leave. So the export reads
 * through the ordinary RLS-guarded path, as the application role, with the
 * tenant context set — exactly like every other query. It is not a
 * privileged back door that happens to be shaped like a feature, and the
 * isolation test proves one workspace's export cannot contain another's
 * rows.
 *
 * Columns are read as they are named in the database rather than mapped to
 * prettier labels. An export is a record, not a report: the value of it is
 * that a row means the same thing outside Tavle as it did inside.
