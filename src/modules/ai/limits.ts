 * novel. The numbers are generous for a person and mean for a script.
 *
 * Three of them, and the third is a different kind (docs/adr/0035). The
 * first two are counted inside the tenant context, so they see one
 * workspace and answer for it: a person in three workspaces has three
 * times the first, and an installation with a thousand workspaces has a
 * thousand times the second. The third is the installation's own roof,
 * counted across every workspace, and it is what stands between a
 * `DEMO=on` front door and a model bill nobody chose.
