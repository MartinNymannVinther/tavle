/**
 * Which Tavle is running.
 *
 * The values come from `env` in next.config.ts, which means they are
 * inlined into the bundle when the app is built. That is deliberate: a
 * running container has no git checkout and no package.json to read, and a
 * version the app has to look up at runtime is a version that can be wrong.
 *
 * Written as literal `process.env.X` reads because that is what Next
 * replaces at build time; destructuring or dynamic lookup would leave them
 * undefined in production. The fallbacks are what tests and any other
 * runtime outside a Next build see.
