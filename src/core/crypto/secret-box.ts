 * environment variable. The trade-off is written down in docs/adr/0006:
 * one secret to protect and no extra step in the deploy guide, at the
 * price that rotating BETTER_AUTH_SECRET makes stored keys unreadable.
 * Unreadable is handled as absent everywhere it matters, so a rotation
 * costs a re-entry of the key, never a broken installation.
