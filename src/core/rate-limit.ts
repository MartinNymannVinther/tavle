/**
 * A small in-process rate limiter for public endpoints — the ones with no
 * session to count against, where the only handle is the caller's address.
 *
 * Deliberately in memory. Tavle runs as one container behind one proxy, so
 * one process is the whole installation and a shared store would be a
 * dependency bought for nothing. The honest limits of that: the counters
 * reset when the app restarts, and an installation that is ever scaled to
 * several instances gets a limit per instance rather than a limit. If that
 * day comes, this is the one file to replace, and the call sites do not
 * change.
 *
 * The authenticated surface does not use this: model calls are counted in
 * the database per user and per workspace (see modules/ai/limits.ts), and
 * Better Auth rate-limits its own endpoints.
