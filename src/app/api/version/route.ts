 * Which release is answering on this host. Public, so a deploy can be

 *
 * This is a deliberate exception to the rule that responses carry no
 * version information. Tavle is AGPL: the source of any given release is
 * public anyway, so the commit tells an attacker nothing the repository
 * does not. What stays out is everything that is about *this* installation
 * rather than the release - runtime versions, environment, migration
 * state - which is why /api/health still answers with nothing but "ok" and
 * the full picture lives behind the login on the About page.
