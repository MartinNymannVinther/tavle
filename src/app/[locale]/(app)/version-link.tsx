 * The running release, at the very foot of the sidebar. Quiet enough to

 * differently than it did yesterday, the first useful question is which
 * code is answering.

 * A build made from an unclean working tree says so, because "0.1.0+a1b2c3d"
 * is a promise that the commit is what is running, and locally it often is
 * not.
