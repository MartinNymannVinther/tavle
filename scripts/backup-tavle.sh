# Runs on the VPS, not in the container. Install as /root/backup-tavle.sh
# (chmod 700) and schedule it from cron; see docs/deploy.md.
#
# The dump is encrypted before it ever leaves the machine, with a public
# key. The matching private key belongs in your password manager and
# nowhere else: a backup an attacker on the server can read is a copy of
# every project, plan and decision you have.
#
# Requires: docker, age, rclone (with an EU remote configured).
