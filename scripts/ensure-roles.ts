/**
 * Give the two runtime database roles their login rights and passwords.
 *
 * This used to live only in `docker/postgres-init/01-roles.sh`, which the
 * Postgres image runs once when the data directory is empty. That works
 * from a checkout and fails on a real deployment: the init directory is
 * bind-mounted from the repository, and a build system that removes its
 * working copy after building leaves the container mounting an empty
 * directory. The script never runs, the migrations create the roles as
 * NOLOGIN (the safe default), and the application is refused by its own
 * database with nothing in any log to say why. That is exactly what
 * happened on the first deployment.
 *
 * So role provisioning belongs with the migrations, which already run as
 * the owner and already run on every deploy. Idempotent by construction:
 * it sets the state it wants rather than assuming what it finds.
 *
 * Passwords are quoted by Postgres itself through `format(%I, %L)` rather
 * than by string concatenation here. DDL cannot take bind parameters, and
 * a password containing a quote would otherwise be an injection.
