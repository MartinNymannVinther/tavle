# ADR 0003: Trigger-based, append-only audit log

Status: accepted · Date: 2026-09-03 (inherited from Haij, ADR 0003 there)

## Decision

`audit_log` records who, what, when, workspace and before/after for every
mutation. Capture is a database trigger (`audit_row_change()`, AFTER
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) on every business-meaningful table, so application
code cannot forget it. Actor and workspace come from the transaction
context; auth-driven writes without a context fall back to the row's own
tenant column (`org_id` on domain tables, `organization_id` on the auth
tables) with `actor_type = 'system'`. A blanket redaction list strips
secrets (`password`, `token`, `secret`, `backup_codes`, OAuth tokens,
verification values, token and key hashes) from the stored row images.

Append-only is enforced in the database itself: the runtime roles have no
UPDATE/DELETE grant, and a trigger raises on UPDATE, DELETE and TRUNCATE —
superusers included.

Semantic events that are not row mutations (login, logout, an application
for access, an approval, an invitation minted or used) are written
explicitly via `recordAuthEvent()`.

The audit log is the operator's record of what happened. It is not the
board's own history: the structured event log a board keeps for its
activity feed and the transition log the numbers are read from are
domain tables with their own purpose, readable by the people in the
workspace. They are logs themselves and carry no audit trigger: auditing
a log is a copy, not a record (ADR 0007).

## Exclusions (deliberate)

`sessions`, `verifications` and `rate_limits` have no row triggers: they
are technical, high-churn tables whose business meaning (who logged in,
when) is captured as semantic events instead. The admission tables have no
row triggers either: they hold personal data about people who are not
users, and the semantic events say what was decided without copying the
application into the trail.

## Trade-offs accepted

- **No foreign keys on `audit_log`.** ON DELETE actions must never be able
  to touch the trail (and append-only would block them anyway). The cost is
  that `org_id`/`actor_user_id` are unconstrained text.
- **Actor granularity.** Better Auth's own writes run without an app
  context, so e.g. `users.insert` at signup is recorded as `system`; the
  adjacent `auth.login` event carries the user.
- **SECURITY DEFINER + superuser-owned.** The trigger function must insert
  into `audit_log` regardless of which confined role fired it; migrations
  therefore run as superuser (see ADR 0002).
- **GDPR tension.** Audit rows are immutable but may reference personal
  data. Workspace export and deletion (wave 2, a dogma) must define the
  audit-log policy explicitly — likely crypto-shredding or time-boxed
  retention. Explicitly deferred, not forgotten.
- **Volume.** before/after jsonb duplicates data. Fine at this scale;
  partitioning by month is the known escape hatch.
