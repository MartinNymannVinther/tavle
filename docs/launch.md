# Launching Tavle

The ordered list for the day this goes live. `docs/deploy.md` is the
reference and explains each piece; this is the sequence, with the things
that are easy to do in the wrong order called out.

Everything here is done once. If you are redeploying an existing
installation, you want section 8 of the deploy guide instead.

## 1. Make the repository public

The repository already exists — `origin` is
`git@github.com:MartinNymannVinther/tavle.git`, `main` is pushed and CI
runs on it — but it is private, and dogma one is not satisfied by a
repository nobody can clone. What is left of this step is the flip.
Coolify deploys from a Git repository either way, so this is about the
dogma rather than about the deployment.

Check before the flip that `git status` is clean and that `git ls-files`
lists no `.env` — `.gitignore` covers both, and CI's gitleaks job is the
second line rather than the first. The check is cheap and the flip is
one-way: the whole history becomes public with it, and nothing about it
can be taken back afterwards.

```bash
gh repo edit MartinNymannVinther/tavle --visibility public \
  --accept-visibility-change-consequences
gh repo edit MartinNymannVinther/tavle \
  --description "Teamets tavle, uden abonnementet. Kanban og Scrum, open source." \
  --homepage https://tavle.haij.dk \
  --add-topic kanban --add-topic scrum --add-topic nextjs \
  --add-topic postgresql --add-topic open-source --add-topic danish
```

Issues are already on. Check that the CI run after the flip is green —
six jobs: quality, tests, build, image, audit, gitleaks. The audit job
runs `pnpm audit --prod`, which is clean as of the pre-release review;
`pnpm audit` on the whole tree still reports three advisories reached
only through the `shadcn` CLI, which is a development dependency and
never ships.

`.github/dependabot.yml` has been opening pull requests since the
repository was created — one grouped pull request a week for the npm
minor and patch traffic, majors on their own, plus GitHub Actions and
Docker base images — and going public changes nothing about that. Keep
reading them rather than merging them blind.

## 2. The Mistral key

Get an API key from the Mistral console and note which region the account
sits in. `docs/subprocessors.md` already names Mistral and the EU endpoint
the code calls; if the account turns out to be somewhere else, that row
has to say so before the first call is made, not after.

Keep the key out of the repository, out of your shell history and out of
this file. It goes in Coolify and nowhere else.

## 3. Server and DNS

Follow deploy guide section 1. A 2 vCPU / 4 GB VPS in an EU region is
enough, and Tavle can share the machine with the other Haij tools —
separate compose stack, separate database, separate domain.

Point `tavle.haij.dk` at the server before you create the application in
Coolify, so the certificate is issued on the first deploy rather than the
second.

## 4. The application in Coolify

Deploy guide section 2. The environment variables, generated fresh —
never reused from another installation:

```
POSTGRES_PASSWORD     openssl rand -hex 24
TAVLE_APP_PASSWORD    openssl rand -hex 24
TAVLE_AUTH_PASSWORD   openssl rand -hex 24
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET    openssl rand -base64 32
BETTER_AUTH_URL       https://tavle.haij.dk
LLM_PROVIDER          mistral
MISTRAL_API_KEY       the key from step 2
TAVLE_COMMIT          the short commit being deployed
```

Hex for the three database passwords: they are pasted into
`postgres://user:PASSWORD@db:5432/tavle`, and a `/` from `base64` would
end the URL there and produce a startup error that names the URL rather
than the password. `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` does not go into a URL and stays
base64.

`SIGNUP` stays unset: it defaults to `closed`, which is what an
installation on the open internet should be. `DEMO` stays unset for now
— step 7 turns it on deliberately, after you have your own account.

`BETTER_AUTH_URL` is the one that hurts to get wrong: passkeys bind to
the origin they were created for, so changing it later locks out anyone
who registered a passkey against the old value. Set it to the final
public URL before anybody signs in.

## 5. First account, and closing the door behind it

Deploy the application, wait for it to come up, and check `/api/health`
and `/api/version` answer.

Then go straight to `https://tavle.haij.dk/register` and create your
account. **This is the one that matters.** An empty installation lets the
first person in and shuts the door the moment that account exists; if
anyone else finds the address first, they become the installation's owner.
Do it within minutes of the first successful deploy, not the next morning.

Add a passkey immediately afterwards under Indstillinger → Sikkerhed, and
TOTP as the second factor. Verify that Indstillinger → Adgang is there —
that is the owner's page, and its presence is the proof the first account
got `platform_role = 'owner'`.

## 6. Backups, before there is anything to lose

Deploy guide section 7: nightly encrypted dumps to EU object storage.
Set it up now rather than after the first real board, and then do the
thing almost nobody does — restore one dump into a scratch database and
open it. A backup nobody has restored is a hope, not a backup.

Then write the provider into `docs/subprocessors.md`, which has a row
waiting for it. A copy of everything is a subprocessor even though `age`
encrypts it before it leaves the machine, and the list is the document
dogma four points customers at.

## 7. Turn the demo on

Set `DEMO=on` in Coolify and redeploy. Open `https://tavle.haij.dk/demo`
in a private window and check that you land on a seeded board with the
demo stripe at the top, that the second board and its insight page are
there, and that `/register` still shows the application form rather than
a sign-up form.

Be clear-eyed about what this does: `DEMO=on` hands out throwaway
accounts on this installation. That is the point of a public instance
whose job is to show the tool, and it is exactly what you would not do on
an organisation's own Tavle. The accounts and their workspaces expire
after 24 hours, and the door is bounded twice — what one address may
build, and how many demos may live at once
(`src/modules/demo/quota.ts`) — with a ceiling inside each one so a
visitor who is through the door cannot fill the database either.

**Schedule the cleanup.** It runs on every visit, which is enough on a
busy day and nothing at all on a quiet one — and /terms promises
twenty-four hours in writing to every visitor. Deploy guide section on
the demo has the two ways; pick one before you turn this on.

Read `/terms` on the live site once, out loud if necessary. It is the page
that tells visitors what happens to what they type, and it should say what
you actually do.

## 8. Dogma seven

> Intet af det vi selv har bygget kommer i vinduet før det har kørt
> rigtigt arbejde.

**Done, 2026-09-22.** A real team ran a whole sprint on a real board —
not a test board and not a copy of one — before any of this was shown to
anybody. The dogma is met and step 9 is no longer waiting on it.

What the step asked for, and what it is still worth doing with: a few
sprints teach what a v1 is missing, and a public read-only link to the
board and mail when a card is assigned are the likeliest first answers.
They should be findings from that team rather than guesses, so the list
of omissions in CLAUDE.md stays a set of decisions rather than an
oversight. One sprint is the dogma satisfied; it is not yet the whole
lesson.

## 9. The tool card

`docs/haij-tool-card.md` has the copy in both languages and the proposed
entry for the site's `tools.ts`. It belongs in the haij.dk repository, not
this one. Two things to check against the site rather than assume: whether
the card already understands a `demo` field, and which value the other
tools use for something in production.

## Afterwards

Watch three things in the first weeks. What the AI costs per real week of
use, which tells you whether Mistral or Ollama is right in the long run.
Whether anyone applies at `/register`, which tells you the card is doing
its job. And how often you reach for something Tavle deliberately does not
have — that list is in CLAUDE.md under product principles, and the
omissions are the product until reality says otherwise.
